# FilmQueryApplication

## Overview:

* This program is a command-line application that will search through
  the current database via queries and will retrieve film data using Java Database Connectivity(JDBC).

## How to run:

* The user is presented a UI where they can enter a selection:
1. Look up a film by its Film ID.
2. Look up a film by the user's search keyword.
3. Exit the application.

* The Application will begin by searching the database via queries
  and will display the result to the user.

* The user will then be returned to the UI where they will be able
  to select one of the two previous options or select three to exit the program.
